    I have a real interest in collecting data, about ourselves, and our
    environment, in order to better understand the context in which we operate.
    I think that collecting data, and analysing it, gives us some real insights
    into our behaviour. It allows us to experiment with making changes, and
    objectively observing how those changes affect us. These articles explore
    that whole topic in various ways.

    business, namely Wossname Industries.
