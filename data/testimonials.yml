    Graeme acted as a technical consultant to Sourcerail, providing me with essential guidance and backup. The breadth and depth of his technical and commercial experience allowed him to guide us to the correct technical and business solutions to the challenges we faced while developing the application.

    Working with Graeme was an absolute pleasure.

    I did some Ruby on Rails development work for Graeme recently, which was both a pleasure and an education. Graeme is one of those rare guys that is as comfortable talking to clients and interpreting their needs as he is coding the solutions to meet those needs. He knows Rails inside out but, more importantly, he also knows how best to use it to deliver great results for his clients. I learned a great deal from him during the project.

    Highly recommended. I really enjoy working with Graeme. He is extremely good at what he does. He is very trustworthy, his code is of impeccable quality, and, for most programming tasks, he is fast - very fast. He probably thinks and types twice as fast as me! If these are qualities that you are looking for, especially trust and quality, then he is very good value for money.

    It's rare enough to find someone that's good at one role, but Graeme somehow manages to be both an awesome technical lead and a great project manager. He has a wealth of experience and an ability to communicate both at a high level -- which makes it easy for non-technical people to understand -- and with the attention to detail that geeks crave. Any project that involves Graeme is going to be a massive success and a lot of fun.

    His rich knowledge of Ruby on Rails, systems architecture and the Internet in general, combined with his practical and pragmatic approach, kept the delivery team relaxed and productive. This enabled us to successfully deliver a large system from a hugely complex set of constantly evolving requirements.

    Azalea Innovations has used Graeme on a number of occassions, most usually to fix mission critical issues that we simply cannot handle in-house. Each and every time we are impressed with how he just gets on with it, makes things work and calms everyone down in the process.

    Graeme is clearly one of those people who just understands what needs to be done. Working with incomplete, inconsistent, and often incoherent briefs, Graeme keeps his cool and works his magic.

    We simply cannot recommend him highly enough.

    The Behind the Medical Headlines site was a fairly successful pilot which we were very keen to develop further, but the site design was becoming dated, was not very user-friendly and was manually intensive in terms of staff support. As such, its ongoing development was not sustainable in its previous form.

    As a result of engaging *[Graeme]*, we now have a considerably more attractive site which is not only more user-friendly and includes a range of new features which could not have been supported under the former design, but is also considerably easier to update.

    The work undertaken by *[Graeme]* has enabled us to reduce staff time required to support the site by approximately 300% and has increased options for staff support and cover through its easy-to-use interface. This has, importantly, provided a considerably more sustainable platform from which we can develop and support the site further.

    In closing, I would add that once briefed, *[Graeme]* provided an excellent tailor-made service and I would strongly recommend *[Graeme]* to others similarly wishing to redevelop and redefine their online presence.
