Last night I gave a wee presentation to the Scottish Ruby User Group about Capistrano 2, and some of the ways I've been working with it over the last couple of weeks, since for some reason I seem to have been immersed in it for a couple of different projects.  It's nothing particularly groundbreaking, but I figured it was useful to demonstrate some of the things it's capable of, and how much easier it makes my life on a daily basis.  You can find a copy of the slides here, complete with my speaker notes:

* [Capistrano 2 Rocks My World (Keynote format)](/dist/capistrano_2.zip)
* [Capistrano 2 Rocks My World (PDF format)](/dist/capistrano_2.pdf)

The speaker notes are probably completely different from what I actually talked about because it turned out that the way I was setup, I couldn't read my notes!  Hey ho, you live and learn!
