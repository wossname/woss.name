I recently read [Counselling For Toads][], an introduction to
[Transactional Analysis][] set in the world of [Wind in the Willows][]. Toad
(of Toad Hall) is depressed, and his friends are worried about him. They
encourage him to seek help in the form of some counselling, to better
understand his feelings, and to learn to cope with them. The story is of Toad's
adventures in counselling, learning about himself, and figuring out his
relationships with his friends.

It's a lovely story, and a great introduction to Transactional Analysis (TA), a
style of psychotherapy developed by [Eric Berne][]. I'll let you into the good
news before you worry too much about poor old Toad: he makes a full recovery,
and develops a new vigour for life. TA is very much of the opinion that all
people are fundamentally good, have worth, and that emotional difficulties are
curable.

There are a few key aspects to TA. These are models used to describe various
aspects of people's personalities, their emotional state, and their
communication with others. These are:

* How people are structured psychologically, modelled as the Parent, Adult and
  Child ego states.

* Our life positions, which govern how we feel about ourselves (I'm (not) OK)
  in relation to other people (You're (not) OK).

* A way of analysing how people communicate with each other. Transactions
  represent a communication, including not only the words said, but the
  psychological meanings implied (or inferred), too. A 'stroke' is an
  individual unit of communication in this transaction. A 'game' is a
  particular, well known, transaction which has a particular set of rules that
  are followed through the communication.

* Our "Life Script", which is written at an early age, and defines our core
  beliefs. As an adult, our life script passes out of direct awareness, but it
  still drives what be believe and how we act.


## Parent, Adult and Child

Your personality manifests itself in your thoughts, feelings and behaviours. An
"ego state" is a facet of your personality which contains an organised cluster
of these thoughts, feelings and behaviours. It's understood that people rarely
have truly distinct ego states (except in the case of multiple personality
disorders), but it's often useful to think of our personalities in terms of
these ego states. Transactional Analysis defines three distinct ego states:

* The **Parent** state, where you are acting (though not necessarily
  consciously) in the same way as your parents (or other parental/authority
  figures from your childhood) would act. Or at least how you interpreted those
  actions at the time -- after all, these learned behaviours were developed
  when you were still very young! The Parent state can be positive -- it can be
  nurturing and caring -- or it can be critical.

* The **Child** state, where your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours manifest
  themselves in the same way as they did when you were a child. The child state
  is the source of your emotions, creativity, and of your 'innate' reactions.
  Child-state behaviours can be positive too -- carefree, creative, happy -- or
  they can be 'adapted' to others.

* The **Adult** state is the objective state, where you are taking in
  information, the surrounding context of a situation, evaluating it without
  the associated emotions and inhibitions. This is where you see reality for
  what it really is.

One of the goals of Transactional Analysis is learning to make more use of the
Adult ego state, in addition to an awareness of the natural reactions of the
Parent and Child states.

The Parent, Adult and Child ego states are within all of us, each becoming
prominent in a variety of different situations. They don't correspond directly
to the actual roles of parents, adults and children. In fact, Malcolm (my son)
telling me off for leaving my dirty socks in the living room would be an
example of his Parent ego state at work (and, most likely, my rebellious Child
state responding, petulantly saying, "I'll pick them up later!").

## I'm OK, You're OK

TA has the concept of a "life position", which defines you psychological state
on two axes: how you feel about yourself, and how you feel about others. This
life position unconsciously affects all of your interactions with other people.
It describes the four quadrants as:

* **I'm OK, you're OK**: I feel good about myself and others. I believe that
  other people are competent, and that they are acting in a way where they
  believe they're doing the right thing. We're all following the
  [Retrospective Prime Directive](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html).

* **I'm not OK, you're OK**: I don't feel good about myself, and I think that
  everyone else is better than me. I'm not good enough, or not important enough
  for other people (who are far smarter/more important) to pay attention to.
  This is where [Imposter Syndrome][] fits in. It's also the quadrant most
  commonly associated with depression and sometimes with suicidal feelings.

* **I'm OK, you're not OK**: I'm better than everyone else. I'm fine, it's
  other people who are weaker, not good enough, or damaged. At the most
  extreme, this is the realm of the psychopath.

* **I'm not OK, you're not OK**: I don't feel good about myself, and I don't
  feel good about the rest of the world, either. There's no hope of rescue.

Both of these axes are continuums, and your position on them can change over
time. Another goal of TA is to help you move into the, "I'm OK, you're OK"
quadrant, which is the nice, healthy, one to be in.

## Strokes & Games

The core concept of Transactional Analysis is around, well, analysing
transactions. A transaction is the flow of communication between two or more
parties. It includes the verbal communication -- the actual words used -- and
the underlying psychological intent of the communication. TA practitioners are
often skilled at noticing non-verbal cues, like tone of voice, body language,
and facial expressions, in order to fully understand the transaction that is
taking place.

Inside of a transaction, the individual units of communication are called
strokes. More specifically, they are a unit of recognition or attention.
Strokes can be positive ("you look nice today!") or negative ("you're an
idiot!"). People *need* strokes and will seek to get whatever strokes they can,
whether they are positive or negative. As children we try out different
strategies for gaining strokes, developing our Child ego state. For example, a
child might throw their dinner across the room, and get told off for it. That
action has become something that generates a stroke of attention, albeit a
negative one.

One of the concepts that TA shares with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is
that of the 'stroke filter'. (In CBT, it's a cognitive bias often called
'discounting the positive'.) The stroke filter stops you from perceiving
particular strokes -- either positive or negative ones. In a depressed state,
you may well not hear positive strokes -- people recognising your work,
receiving praise, taking compliments. These strokes no longer fit with your
mental model of yourself, so you're unable to assimilate them. It's not that
you make an active choice not to hear these compliments, it's really that
you're unable to accept them, because they don't fit with your view of reality.

Transactions follow a couple of different patterns:

* **Reciprocal** transactions are where the two participants are correctly
  addressing the ego state that the other person is in. They might both be in
  the same ego state (e.g. Adult <-> Adult conversation), or they might be in
  complementary ego states (e.g. one participant is the Parent talking to a
  Child ego state, and the other participant is in the Child ego state,
  responding to the Parent). This sort of transaction can continue indefinitely.

* **Crossed** transactions occur when one participant is addressing an ego
  state the other isn't engaged in. For example, a conversation initiated by
  the first participant is engaged as an Adult <-> Adult, but the respondent is
  really in the Child ego state and responds as they would to a Parent. This transaction often results in conflict.

A "game" is a sequence of transactions that occurs between two or more parties
and leads to a predetermined outcome. Though not done consciously, both parties
subconsciously know the outcome of the game and act their parts in it. Since
this behaviour is subconscious, it's always enacted between the Parent and
Child ego states of the participants, as the Adult ego is the conscious
awareness. Eric Berne's best known book, [Games People Play][] defines a
catalogue of common games, describing the roles played in each, and the payoff
that the players are looking for.

## Counselling For Geeks

My idea when I started writing this was to try and think of analogies that
would appeal to the likes of me, so that I could more effectively explain them.
However, having reached this point, I've still only scratched the surface of
Transactional Analysis. I'd like to do the same for other therapeutic
strategies, including: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (spoiler alert: having had
a few rounds of CBT, I don't have a terribly high opinion -- it feels like
little more than a band-aid), Mindfulness, Cognitive Analytic Therapy, and
Compassion-Focused Therapy.

I've had a little experience with most of them over the past year. There are
many common themes throughout them, but there are some interesting differences,
too. Different therapies suit different people, so it's interesting to contrast
the different techniques.

And I'd really like to figure out some analogous concepts from computer
science, from engineering, or from geek culture, to help explain these
concepts. Apart from anything else, I know that a good analogy helps to develop
a deeper understanding of a concept.

So I'd like to ask for your help. Can you think of some analogies that would
help to describe the concepts behind Transactional Analysis? How would you use
geeky analogies to describe other therapies?
