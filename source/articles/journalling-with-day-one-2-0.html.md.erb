title: Journalling with Day One 2.0
description: |
  I’ve been using Day One for a few years now. Since version 2.0 has just been
  released, I thought I’d explain how I use it for journalling.

  for a few years now, I think. In fact, I’ve just had a wee look, and the first
  entry that doesn’t look like it was imported from elsewhere is just over four
  years old. In the time that I’ve used it, I’ve amassed 2,848 entries, though
  some of them have been imported from previous journalling experiments. I
  thought, since version 2.0 was released today, I’d try writing my first entry
  in it by explaining how I use Day One, what other tools I’ve tried in the
  past, and maybe even mention a couple of features I’m hoping will come to it
  some day!

I’ve been using Day One
([Day One 2.0 for Mac](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12&uo=4&at=1010lbgm&ct=website)
and

for a few years now, I think. In fact, I’ve just had a wee look, and the first
entry that doesn’t look like it was imported from elsewhere is just over four
years old. In the time that I’ve used it, I’ve amassed 2,848 entries, though
some of them have been imported from previous journalling experiments. I
thought, since version 2.0 was released today, I’d try writing my first entry
in it by explaining how I use Day One, what other tools I’ve tried in the
past, and maybe even mention a couple of features I’m hoping will come to it
some day!

I think things through by writing them down. Some people think by
talking — thinking out loud — but I like to have a clear idea of what I’m going
to say before I say it. I find it easiest to do so by writing them out. It
works for thoughts that I’m not trying to communicate with other people, too. I
find that I can understand my own thinking and, to an extent, my feelings, just
by committing them to paper. For the most part, I could then just throw away
the bit of paper — it has served its purpose — but I’m a hoarder, and I’m
loathed to throw things away, particularly when they can be cheaply encoded as
bits and live in the cloud!

Enter Day One. It’s a journalling application for the Mac, and for iOS (it’s
universal, so it works great on the iPhone and the iPad, including the new iPad
Pro with the latest version!). Entries are timestamped, and you can navigate to
old entries through a calendar. You can tag entries, and later search for
entries with particular tags[^1]. It also captures
other contextual data around the time you create the post, including your
location, your current activity (which is more relevant if you’re walking
around with your iPhone), and the current weather conditions. I have a real
interest in capturing contextual information around the time that you’re
writing, so I’m keen to see what can be done with this metadata!

It has full Markdown support (including footnotes, which makes me very happy,
though sadly Medium doesn’t let me replicate them here!) which I consider to be
essential. I write in Markdown even in apps that don’t support it, going back
later on and mucking around with formatting if I need to. It means I can focus
on what I’m writing, instead of worrying about how it looks. The human brain
isn’t really designed to consider both of these endeavours at the same time!
We’ve been able to add a single image to an entry for a while now (though I
rarely use the feature), but version 2.0 has brought the ability to add
multiple images. Perhaps that’ll be a useful workflow for keeping track of what
I’m up to when I’m out and about (instead of just sharing all the photos on
[Instagram][3]!), or maybe I can use it as a way of selecting images to go
along with a draft post destined for [Medium][4].

The major new feature with 2.0, though, is that I can now have multiple
journals. (I’m quietly hoping that the major new feature in version 2.1 is
going to be that I can share certain journals with other people!) It’s perhaps
worth talking about the two distinct purposes I have for journalling in Day
One: morning pages, and keeping track of what I’ve been doing.

## Morning Pages

I can’t remember who introduced me to the idea of Morning Pages, but it’s a
habit I’ve been more-or-less sticking to for several years now. I gather that
it’s described in [The Artist’s Way][5] but I confess that I haven’t read it!
The idea (to me) is pretty simple. First thing in the morning, as soon as you
get out of bed — after you’ve made a coffee, of course; there are greater
priorities in life than writing! — you sit down and write about whatever’s in
your head. The goal is to write about 3 sheets of A4 paper, which is long
enough to tease out the things that are really bothering you, but short enough
that it can be completed in the time it takes to drink your first coffee of the
day. Before discovering Day One, I’d been using a web app for this purpose,
called [750 Words][6]. I’m happy with his reasoning that 3 pages is about equal
to 750 words, so that’s what I aim for each day, though I don’t give myself a
hard time if I stray too far from the target any longer. That’s another welcome
feature in version 2.0 of the Mac app which has been in the iOS version for a
while: it now displays a word count in the metadata bar at the bottom.
Previously I had to save the entry, then look at its info menu to see the
number of words I’d written that morning. Cue several rounds of hitting
‘Done’, checking my word count, then feeling obliged to edit & add more on a
slow-brain day!

### Using Pen and Paper

In the past, I’ve used other tools for my morning pages. For a long while, I
was using pen and paper. I do rather like the pace of hand writing words. I’m
slowed down enough by the pen that I can think more deeply than I tend to when
I rattle characters off on the keyboard. I’ve a thing for stationery, too. I
love Pilot G-Tec C4 pens which have a really thin — 0.4mm! — point:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="1643b974f9ba429ca3bbfb1fbd462fc3" data-card-controls="0">
  <p>
    New bio-polymer gel ink gives consistent inkflow. Ultrafine writing with no
    ink spread. Suitable for fax and NCR paper. Line width: 0.2mm.

</blockquote>

They suit my — fairly dense, small — handwriting. When I’m in a more colourful mood,
I adore the Staedtler fineliners:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="1643b974f9ba429ca3bbfb1fbd462fc3" data-card-controls="0">
  <p>
    Staedtler-Triplus Fineliner Pens: Multi. This water-based ink is in an
    ergonomic triangular shape pen for relaxed and easy writing. These pens can
    be left uncapped for days without drying up. This package contains ten pens
    with 0.3mm tips in assorted colors.

    </a>

</blockquote>

And I’m a fan of Moleskine notebooks, in particular, the cahier jotters:

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="1643b974f9ba429ca3bbfb1fbd462fc3" data-card-controls="0">
  <p>
    Moleskine Notebooks, the journals that evolved from a legendary notebook.
    This version of the basic, yet classic ruled journal notebook is a stylish
    travel companion, perfect for writings, thoughts and passing notes.

</blockquote>

But handwriting has its downsides, too, mostly in terms of recall. It’s not
always easy to discover things I’ve written about before when I want to find
them again. (In fact, I’ve got a stack of notebooks that I’d like to have typed
up, if anyone fancies a wee job!)

### Using Evernote

I’ve also used [Evernote][10] for journalling. It’s not bad. It didn’t support
Markdown, which didn’t stop me writing that way, it just meant that my notes
weren’t as well formatted as they could have been. I’ve found it to be a pain
to get notes out of Evernote en masse, too. But the biggest thing that bothered
me about using it for my own writing is that I like using it as a filing system
for other people’s material. I dump all the bits of paper I get (bank
statements, utility bills, company correspondence, letters from my doctor,
etc) into there, and I don’t really like mixing the stuff that originated in
my head with the stuff that comes from other people. I like keeping them in
separate silos. I’m sure I’m missing a trick around intelligently finding
relationships between bits of content in each silo, but I’ll live with that
for now.

## Status Updates

The other thing I use Day One for regularly is to keep track of what I’m up to
right now. I’m not always good at keeping notes as I do things, and I’m
terrible at remembering specifically what I’ve accomplished during the day when
I come to note down my achievements in [iDoneThis][11]. (You know when you ask
a six year old, “So, what did you do in school today?” and they universally
answer, “I can’t remember!”? Well I never grew out of that.) Day One has this
delightful feature called reminders. On the Mac, you can have it pop up an
alert at certain intervals during the day, where it’ll allow you to dash down a
quick entry straight from the menu bar, then get back on with what you were
doing. I’ve got it set up to prompt me for an entry every hour of the working
day. When it pops up, I note down what I’ve been up to over the past hour, save
it, then carry on. It’s a great way to have a short checkpoint, to reflect on
what you’ve been up to, make sure you’re not getting sidetracked, and to note
down the things that you’ll inevitably forget in a few hours.

All sorts of content winds up in there from these entries. Sometimes it’ll just
be a few words on what I’ve been doing. Other times, it’ll turn into a longer
brain dump when I’ve been researching something. Quite often, I’ll copy and
paste a complex command line, or some subtle SQL I’ve been hand crafting, just
in case it comes in handy again in future. It beats grepping my zsh history to
find it again!

## Feature Requests

So how’s the future looking for me and Day One? It’s pretty rosy. Put it this
way, the new version was a paid upgrade (£18 for the pair of them) and it was
an instabuy this morning, as soon as I saw the tweet that it had been released.
It’s an app that’s a core part of my daily life, and I’m delighted to be able
to support further development by buying the new version. I’m quite excited by
what the future might bring, too, particularly with multiple journals and the
app having its own synchronisation service. I’m really hoping that they’ll open
up an API to third party tools, so I can post journal entries from other apps,
and have other (web) apps consume the entries I create here. (In the past, I’ve
mucked around with [IFTTT][12], [Dropbox][13], and a command line tool to get
entries into Day One as a result of events happening on other web apps, but it
was a bit… flaky.)

I’d love for the text search to become more intelligent. Right now, it will
search based on words, and it’ll return all entries that contain the matching
word(s), ordered by recency. I want a proper search engine for my 2,848
entries — something that’ll rank the results, and allow me to construct more
complex searches. Saved searches would be handy, too. Another thing a ‘proper’
search engine would enable is automatically surfacing related content using
some sort of semantic analysis. This would allow me to discover old entries
that are related to what I’m currently writing.

I did really like 750 Words’ semantic analysis, where it would give you some
insight into how you were thinking or feeling, based on the content of what
you’d written. I guess that’s pretty specific to my use case, so I’m not sure
it would suit the core Day One apps. But if there’s a third party API to read
journals, then somebody else could implement it, right? 😀

All in all, I’m very happy with Day One, and I’ll be continuing to use it to
capture my daily ramblings for the foreseeable future. The next trick is to try
and get me to share more of those ramblings, instead of talking into the echo
chamber! How about you give [Day One for iOS][14] and its companion [Day One
for Mac][15] a shot today? I’d love to hear how you get along with it!

[^1]: I have to confess I’m not terribly good at tagging things. It’s difficult
  to predict how you’ll want to find something ahead of time. I’d rather just
  rely on good full-text search.
