    I have a real interest in collecting data, about ourselves, and our environment, in order to better understand the context in which we operate. I think that collecting data, and analysing it, gives us some real insights into our behaviour. It allows us to experiment with making changes, and objectively observing how those changes affect us. These articles explore that whole topic in various ways.

While I'm chipping away at the content for the book, I come up with all sorts of articles that might stand alone. These are them. If the content here appeals to you, you should definitely check out the web site, and subscribe to the mailing list to keep up to date on its developments.
