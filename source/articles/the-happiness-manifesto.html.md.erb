  I make a first attempt at defining a company manifesto for Wossname Industries, around experimentation, measurement, and happiness.

      This is how the manifesto started out, when I tweeted the company's mission: "to measurably improve the long term happiness of both individuals and organisations." Does the manifesto stand up to that?

I'm working my way through the [Happy Startup School](http://www.thehappystartupschool.com/)'s online course on building the sort of company that you wouldn't want to sell. Today's task is to figure out a manifesto for the business that defines the underlying principles through which it operates. I've already written a little about the company's [overall mission](https://woss.name/articles/the-happiness-mission): to measurably improve the long term happiness of both individuals and organisations. The intent here is to take the ideas from that mission and flesh out a little more detail.

I believe that **happiness is a journey, not a destination**. We don't achieve an end goal of "being happy” but we can make a number of changes throughout our lives in order to improve our mental wellness over time. I also believe that **everyone can improve their long term happiness** &mdash; no matter their background, personal circumstances, environment or current level of happiness. There's always something to improve on.

I have a background in software development and operations. I'm a firm believer in the idea that **you can't improve what you don't measure**. From a software development perspective, we measure the performance of a piece of code before we try to improve it. In operations, we tend to measure the throughput of systems to see what effect changes have. In business, we have [key performance indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) that allow us to measure the health of the business. I reckon that **we can measure happiness**  perhaps not in absolute terms, but at least the change in happiness over time &mdash; and other metrics that impact on mental wellness.

I believe that the way to improve something is to **conduct experiments**. There is **no one-size-fits-all way** to improve your happiness. A lot of it depends on your personal circumstances, and your current mental state (there's not a lot of point in mucking around with [Maslow's self-actualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Self-actualization) if your [physiological needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Physiological_needs) are not yet being met). But if we have a framework through which you can conduct experiments to improve your mental health, then you can try things out, see the results, and use that information to **make informed changes** that will improve your happiness.

(You can see where this is going, right? I want to build [Graphite][3] and [Nagios][4] &mdash; but for humans &mdash; with a set of tools on top that will allow you to perform experiments on yourself. I'm tempted to suggest that there's an opportunity around building a generic framework for performing experiments on anything you can measure, but I'll save that thought for a future pivot!)
