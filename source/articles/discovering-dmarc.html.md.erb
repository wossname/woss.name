  all about.

  I only just discovered Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &
  Conformance (DMARC) today, as I was writing up some notes for an article on
  setting up email for a new domain. While I was writing the section on DKIM,
  I got to thinking, "That's all well and good, but how do I advertise the fact
  that all my email sources are DKIM-signing messages, and that anything which
  isn't signed is probably spam?" It turns out that DMARC is the answer to
  that question &mdash; and more &mdash; and it's widely deployed. In addition to allowing
  you to state that you sign everything, you can also opt in to getting reports
  from mail service providers with details on what email is getting dropped.

I only just discovered
[Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)](https://dmarc.org/)
today, as I was writing up some notes for an article on setting up email for a
new domain. While I was writing the section on DKIM, I got to thinking,
<q>That's all well and good, but how do I advertise the fact that all my email
sources are DKIM-signing messages, and that anything which isn't signed is
probably spam?</q> It turns out that DMARC is the answer to that question
&mdash; and more &mdash; and it's widely deployed. In addition to allowing you
to state that you sign everything, you can also opt in to getting reports from
mail service providers with details on what email is getting dropped.

DMARC builds upon both [DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)](http://www.dkim.org/)
and the [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](http://www.openspf.org/) &mdash; which
I'll talk about in detail another day if you like. It uses them to define the
policy of what it considers as "non-aligned" (potentially spam) email. You
can then stipulate what you want the recipient's mail service to do with that
email, and request automated reports on how the recipient's service treats your
messages. Getting these reports allows you to gain feedback on what messages
other mail systems are dropping, alerting you to any misconfiguration or rogue
activity on services you run, which is a valuable feedback loop.

As an experiment, I've just deployed it on a couple of domains, purely in a
reporting capacity. I want to see what form these reports take and whether
I've got my mail servers configured correctly. It's worth noting that the
systems I use for email aren't ones I control &mdash; I use
[Google Apps](https://goo.gl/zdwZfd) for email, [Intercom](https://intercom.io/)
for customer[^1] conversations, and [MailChimp](http://eepurl.com/bOLGs1)
for newsletters. All of these apps support both SPF and DKIM, so I'm well
covered.

If you would like to do the same, head across to your DNS provider's web UI,
and go to the list of DNS records for your domain. Create a new record set.
The name for the record is `_dmarc` (so any mail system can look up the
well-known name `_dmarc.yourdomain.com` to get your policy), and the type is
`TXT`. The value we'll start out with will be something along the lines of:

```
"v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@woss.name; ruf=mailto:postmaster@woss.name"
```

Remember to change the email addresses in there &mdash; I don't want your
reports! Right now, this is purely an attempt to get some information on what
would happen if I were to enable it properly. We can break it down as follows:

* It starts out with a familiar-looking version parameter (it's the same style
  as SPF & DKIM), saying we're formatting the record according to the DMARC v1
  specification.

* `p=none` is our policy for dealing with non-aligned email on this domain.
  We're saying, <q>don't take any further action</q> for now, but if the
  deployment is successful, we'll upgrade that to quarantine or even reject.

* The next parameter, `sp=none` specifies what to do with messages that come
  from a subdomain (e.g. `hello@happy.woss.name`). For now, I'm mirroring the
  policy for the root domain, but I expect I'll quickly upgrade that to reject,
  since I don't (intend to) send any email from subdomains.

* The next two parameters are the interesting ones at this stage in the
  deployment. It's worth noting that I've already got the email address
  `postmaster@woss.name` pointed at a real mailbox, as tradition &mdash; and
  an RFC or two &mdash; dictates.

* With `rua=mailto:postmaster@woss.name`, I'm requesting that other email
  providers send aggregate (daily, I think) reports to that particular email
  address. It's handy that this is a URI &mdash; I imagine there's software
  out there that accepts the reports as a webhook and does further automated
  processing before bothering a human being.

* The `ruf=mailto:postmaster@woss.name` parameter is similar but is for
  forensic reports. I'm imagining this being details of individual failures,
  that it'll be useful for debugging, and that I'm rapidly going to switch it
  off because the volume of traffic from it is annoying! The
  [Google Apps documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466563) I
  read earlier says that it doesn't support the `ruf` parameter, so I don't
  know if I'll see much from it.

There are a few other options you can use &mdash; specifying whether an SPF
failure or a DKIM failure should be considered non-aligned, and suggesting a
percentage of email to which the policy should apply, so you can do gradual
rollouts &mdash; but this is good enough for just now. I'll pop back in a
couple of days, when I've had some reports, and discover just how much spam
purports to be from my domains!
