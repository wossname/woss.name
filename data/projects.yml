    The Happiness Project's goal is to give you a tool that you can use to improve your happiness. In particular, this tool allows you to perform experiments intended to improve your mental wellbeing, measure their results, and discover their impact.

    This project has been my main focus in 2016. Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to effectively measure happiness. How do you objectively measure how content you are? It's a tricky one! I'm performing some experiments of my own to see if I can figure out how.

    I want to go on a holistic exploration of how developers write code in a sustainable, enjoyable way. I want to hear about their physical environment; the tools they use for development; the SaaS apps they use to make their lives easier; the productivity methodologies they subscribe to; how they balance work and life; and what they do when they're not at the computer.

    The plan is to interview software developers, and learn how they work. Chances are these conversations will turn into a podcast, but I might fall back on articles if I can't stand the sound of my own voice!

    Have you ever wondered how well you're climbing, how much better you're getting after all these sessions you're putting in at the local climbing wall? Is all that effort you've put in at the gym actually paying off in terms of achieving the 7a route you've been wanting to crack? Are you training towards a competition? Or would you just like some objective feedback that your climbing is improving?

    That's the main goal of this application. While you're at the climbing wall, you can take note of the climbs that you achieve each session. We'll use a patented super-secret formula to give your session an overall score, based on the number of climbs, the height of each climb and the grading of the route. And you can watch that score improve over time, as your climbing gets better!

    How does The Internet work? When you type <code>www.google.com</code> into your browser bar and hit enter, what happens next? How does your instruction turn into a beautifully rendered page? What are all the moving parts that come into play to allow you &ndash; and, simultaneously, a billion other people &ndash; to surf the \'net?

    This is a quest to find out the answer. I already know lots of little bits of the puzzle, but there are some that I'm rusty about, or which have changed significantly in the past 20 years, so I've got plenty of research to do! Ultimately, I'm going to condense the results into a book but, in the meantime, I'm producing articles on various associated topics.

    I've always dreamed of having a "smart‚Äù house, where I can control the home environment through technology. This dream is slowly becoming a reality with Apple HomeKit. I'm finding that I'm on the bleeding edge of the early adopter curve when it comes to the technology. Documentation, and user experience stories, are a little sparse. So I'm writing articles here, and I'm collecting information on currently available products.

    If you're interested in finding out more about HomeKit, I'd love for you to stop by, and even join in the community.

    This is a daft wee side project, just to play around with Rails 5. If you use affiliate links in your articles, you're probably aware that Apple have geographically aware links. They'll give you a single URL you can put in your articles, and it will redirect visitors to the correct App Store for their geographical region.

    Amazon, on the other hand, don't seem to have this feature. But it can't be that difficult to implement. So that's what I'm tinkering with building in my spare hours right now. Worst case, it'll be useful to me. But you never know, it may be handy for you, too!
