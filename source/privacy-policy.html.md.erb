  I gather that having a privacy policy is a legal requirement, so I quickly
  nabbed a pre-packaged one. The <abbr class="initialism" title="Too long;
  didn't read">TL;DR</abbr> version is that I take your privacy seriously, and
  I don't sell on your personally identifiable data, but I do use 3rd party
  services to manage it. So, without further ado, one generic privacy policy!
