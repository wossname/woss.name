If only.

"A mouse? A fucking mouse? How can that little bastard be the scariest thing in
this wood?" The Gruffalo stomped on a vole, crushing its tiny body under the
heel of his ferocious foot. It didn't make him feel any better, despite the
satisfying crunch. His mood really was as black as his tongue.

"I had him. A couple of slices of bread, a little brown sauce, and a little
brown mouse. I could have eaten him. My favourite food, too. How the hell did I
get outsmarted by my favourite food?"

All was quiet in the deep, dark wood, save for the Gruffalo beating a path back
home through the undergrowth. Then after a bit, the Gruffalo heard a rustling
in the trees ahead. It was fox, with a sly grin on his face.

"Why hello", said fox, "he he. Did you just get your ass kicked by a mouse?
Seriously, I was ready for eating that wee shrimp, but I already had a lovely
lunch planned, and I didn't want to spoil my appetite. Not that the wee squirt
would have put me off my lunch much. There's so little meat on him, he'd hardly
count as a snack."

"You'd take on the mouse, would you?" said the Gruffalo, trying to put on a
brave face. "I've seen him rip the entrails from an owl and wear them as a
souvenir."

"You're having me on", said the fox, but he didn't sound quite so sure.
Admittedly, he hadn't seen Owl for a while. "Anyway, I'm off for that lunch."

"Not so fast", said the Gruffalo. "My favourite food might be a little brown
mouse panini, but I'm hungry and I'll settle for a fox Bento box." Quick as the
wind, he lashed out at Fox with his terrible claws, and ripped open his
jugular. Fox twitched for a few seconds, then lay still.

"Ach, sod it, scrawny wee fox, there's hardly any meat on him -- looks like
he's barely even been living on mice lately", thought the Gruffalo. "I can't be
arsed dragging him back and preparing Bento Box Fox." And with two crunches of
his terrible teeth in his terrible jaws, fox was gone.

On through the wood the Gruffalo stomped. His mood still hadn't improved when
he heard a hoot in the trees ahead. The story of Owl's demise was overstated --
there he was, swooping overhead. He crapped pellets on the Grufallo's head,
hooting, "Why Gruffalo, hello! Loser. I must have eaten more mice than you've
had hot dinners!"

"Come down here and say that, Owl, I'll show you. Brown mouse baguette might be
my favourite snack, but I'd settle for disembowelled owl."

Owl was feeling cocky, so he landed on a nearby branch, still hooting
raucously. "I can't believe you got beat by that mouse. How stupid are you?"

The Gruffalo snapped and lunged at Owl, catching him by the talons. Startled,
Owl lashed out with his beak, and pecked blindly. He caught the Gruffalo right
on the wart at the end of his nose. The wart burst, spreading a thick, green,
liquid across Owl's eyes and feathers.

"Aargh, it burns, it burns!" screamed Owl. He wasn't kidding. Owl's feathers
had started smoking, and turning into a bubbling goo. "I can't see, I'm blind,
I'm blind!" screeched Owl in a panic. The corrosive poison in the Grufallo's
wart was fast acting. Minutes later, Owl was nothing but a bubbling, oozing
mess.

"What a waste", said the Gruffalo, nursing his now wart-less nose. "I could
have coped with a bowl of owl soup, but I'm not eating *that*. It looks like
melted ice cream..." The Gruffalo continued tramping through the deep, dark
wood, leaving the owl puddle behind. After a while, he heard a slithering, and
a sniggering, in the leaves ahead.

"Ss-ss-ss-ss", sniggered Snake. "Ssseriously. A mouse? How sssad are you?"
Snake disengaged his lower jaw, spreading his mouth open wide, fangs
glistening. But he couldn't keep it up for long -- he was still creasing
himself laughing. "I've eaten bigger things whole."

The Gruffalo was sick of this humiliation. He had to cover it up, make sure
nobody could tell the story again. "There's nothing worth eating on him, but I
could always use a snakeskin belt", he thought. He kicked out and his turned
out toes caught snake, stunning him. He lifted snake up and, holding him behind
him like a towel, rubbed him up and down the purple prickles on his back. The
sharp prickles tore at snake's skin, quickly ripping him in two.

"Well, that was silly", thought the Gruffalo, "he's too small for a belt, but I
could always make a pair of garters."

"What a day", thought the Gruffalo miserably. "I'm humiliated by that bastard
mouse, mocked by Fox, crapped on by an owl and sniggered at by a snake. What
have I become?" He couldn't face going home. Surely the tale would have spread
-- after all, he hadn't yet dealt with the source. He still had this nagging
doubt, "but what if he really that scary?"

It was inescapable.

All was quiet through the deep, dark, wood. The mouse spotted the lifeless body
of the Gruffalo, swinging from the branch of a tree, hanging by a makeshift
snake rope. He felt a small twinge of guilt. But the final hemp dance of the
Gruffalo had caused a nut to fall from the tree, which took the mouse's mind
off the horrific scene. The nut? The nut was good.
