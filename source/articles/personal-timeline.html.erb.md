title: A Personal Timeline
subtitle: Recording a personal history
excerpt: |
  I built a simple web app to enter details of a personal historical timeline,
  and use [TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) to display the resulting
  timeline. Mostly, I'm sharing the code just in case it's of use to somebody
  else.

As part of a larger project I'm doing, I had a need to write out a personal
timeline -- a potted history of my life, along with any particular emotions
associated with each event. Of course, in order to distract myself from the
task at hand, and instead of using the A4 sheet of paper I'd been given, I went
looking for some software to help out.
[TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) turned out to be exactly what I
was looking for.

I started out by maintaining the JSON source file manually (I could have used
Google Docs, but I'm allergic to spreadsheets!), adding bits and pieces as I
could remember them. That got dull -- and error prone (it got upset every time
I missed out a `,` between entries!) -- pretty quickly, though, so I'd chuck
together some code as a web front end to produce the JSON data.

I wondered if it could be handy for others, too, so I've shared the code on
GitHub at [mathie/timelines](https://github.com/mathie/timelines/) and I've got
an instance of it running here: <https://personal-timelines.herokuapp.com/> You
can sign up to create timelines and either share them publicly, or keep them
private. You can also share a private timeline with collaborators, who can see
the timeline and make changes to it. Being able to share a private timeline
with my wee sister (who has a much better memory than me!) was the main reason
I felt the need to build this app in the first place.

The app itself is pretty straightforward. There's nothing I wanted to implement
that needed anything more than ordinary RESTful operations -- I managed to
think of every operation in terms of creating or updating a resource. It always
pleases me when I manage to build a design so it's all just CRUD operations.
And the refactoring which took me from a timeline belonging to a user, through
to a timeline having many collaborators (a `has_many through:` assocation),
worked rather neatly. After changing the associations themselves, the only
other code I had to update was one line figuring out authorisation.

And for an example of what it can do, here's a (slightly condensed) version of
[my timeline](https://personal-timelines.herokuapp.com/timelines/a7cefba9-9fcf-4ab0-be3b-e0d74d94ad7e).

After all that effort, I suppose I should get back to the task at hand and
figure out what to add to the timeline. Knowing that I've been in continuous
employment since I turned 16, and that I've moved home more than a dozen times
since I left for University is interesting an' all, but I suspect I'm missing
the underlying point of the exercise... What sort of personal history would you
like to record on a timeline?
