    I'm one of those types of folks who can turn their hand to a bit of
    everything. I do web app development, using the Ruby on Rails framework.
    I do iOS development &ndash; apps for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch
    &ndash; with Swift. I cover the full gamut of services that come under
    the DevOps banner. And I'll even project manage myself into the bargain.
    If you're looking for a good all-rounder who can be your entire
    development team then, as Leonard Cohen sang: I'm your man!
  </p>

  <p>
    If your project is too big for one person, or if you're in a hurry to get
    it launched, I can still help out. I've got a crack team of contractors I
    regularly work with, who can lend a hand with chunks of a project. We
    work together regularly, and we get on well, so we make for a great team.
    If your needs mean that you need to hire a full-time development team, I
    can help out with that side of things, too. (Oh, and if you're in the
    market for somebody who can climb rocks, I'm definitely up for that!)

        I first discovered Ruby on Rails back in 2005, before it reached
        1.0. I fell in love with its simplicity and expressiveness, and
        I've been using it ever since. They require different tactics, but
        it suits projects large and small. I've used it to build apps that
        are used by a dozen people, and I've helped build systems that
        scale to hundreds of thousands of users.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Naturally, I do a fair chunk of JavaScript, too, when needs dictate
        it. I can't say I'm much of a designer, but if I'm handed a CSS
        framework, I can put it to good use. I've got some ace designers
        around who can help me with the finer points of user experience.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I've put together a wee web site dedicated to my Ruby on
        Rails-related services:

      <p>
        I've built a fair few projects on iOS. Most of them have been
        focused on the iPhone as the primary use case, but thanks to
        Apple's clever adaptive user interfaces, they all looked good on
        the iPad, too. I haven't yet had an excuse to build something for
        the Apple Watch, but I'd love to give it a try!
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I cut my teeth on Objective-C back in 2003, writing an XMPP chat
        app for Mac OS X, but recently I've switched entirely to Swift for
        iOS projects. It's a delightful language, and I reckon it's the way
        forward when it comes to developing for Apple's platforms.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Right now, I'm really interested in what we can do when we combine
        mobile apps with additional sensors to better understand our
        environment &ndash; on a personal level with Apple Health, or
        throughout our dwellings with HomeKit. There's a lot we can learn
        by collecting data from our context, correlating it, and producing
        insights&hellip;

      <p>
        I could talk all day about configuration management, if you give me
        the chance. I've built, deployed, and scaled physical servers, even
        racking a few of them myself. These days, much like everyone else,
        I rather like the flexibility of cloud-based services, whether
        that's plain ol' virtual machines, or using entirely managed
        services from the likes of Amazon or Google. It all depends on the
        size of the project, and the budget. I can help you figure out the
        right platform to build upon, and when you should be looking at
        transitioning to alternative solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to running services, I've tended to manage machines
        with Chef or Puppet, but these days I'd probably opt for a fleet of
        disposable Docker containers, and the infrastructure to build them.
        I've run web servers, mail servers, message queues, databases, DNS
        services &ndash; in fact, I'm old enough to have run Usenet News
        servers!
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, my interest in all things Ops-related is such that I'm
        writing a wee book in my spare time called
        <%= utm_link_to 'A Sneak Peek at The Internet', 'https://the-internet.io/', target: '_blank' %>.
        Its goal is to give software developers some insight into how the
        Internet they rely on really works.

    <% featured_list_item(title: 'Managing Humans', subtitle: 'hiring, running, and scaling teams', icon: :user) do %>
      <p>
        I've run a few teams on various projects. I can define software
        development processes &ndash; Agile ones, to one degree or another
        &ndash; and help teams work with them. I've interviewed dozens of
        developers, and I'm pretty good at spotting the ones who'll best
        fit a particular project. On the whole, I'd rather write code, but
        it's reassuring to know I can handle this end of the spectrum too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Talking of software development processes, I'm definitely in the
        Agile camp. To me, agility is all about being able to respond to
        change. If the code we write is able to change in response to the
        ever-flighty needs of the market, then I feel I've done a good job.
        If we're able to change our process to suit the business as it
        scales, then we're doing the right thing. I do my best work when we
        can deliver small things, frequently, and I've always found that to
        be a workflow which suits the companies I work with.
