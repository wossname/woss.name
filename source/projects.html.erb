      We've got all sorts of projects on the go at any one time. Mostly we're
      trying out new ideas, practicing new techniques, or just playing with a
      new technology.

          <h3>The Happiness Project</h3>

          <p>
            The Happiness Project's goal is to give you a tool that you can
            use to improve your happiness. In particular, this tool allows
            you to perform experiments intended to improve your mental
            wellbeing, measure their results, and discover their impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project has been my main focus in 2016. Right now, we're
            trying to figure out how to effectively measure happiness. It's a
            tricky one!

          <h3>How I Code</h3>

          <p>
            I want to go on a holistic exploration of how developers write code
            in a sustainable, enjoyable way. I want to hear about their
            physical environment; the tools they use for development; the SaaS
            apps they use to make their lives easier; the productivity
            methodologies they subscribe to; how they balance work and life;
            and what they do when they're not at the computer.
          </p>

          <p>
            The plan is to interview software developers, and learn how they
            work. Chances are these conversations will turn into a podcast, but
            I might fall back on articles if I can't stand the sound of my own
            voice!

          <h3>Rock (Climbing) Club</h3>

          <p>
            Have you ever wondered how well you're climbing, how much better
            you're getting after all these sessions you're putting in at the
            local climbing wall? Is all that effort you've put in at the gym
            actually paying off in terms of achieving the 7a route you've been
            wanting to crack? Are you training towards a competition? Or would
            you just like some objective feedback that your climbing is
            improving?
          </p>

          <p>
            That's the main goal of this application. While you're at the
            climbing wall, you can take note of the climbs that you achieve
            each session. We'll use a patented super-secret formula to give
            your session an overall score, based on the number of climbs, the
            height of each climb and the grading of the route. And you can
            watch that score improve over time, as your climbing gets better!

          <h3>A Sneak Peek at The Internet</h3>

          <p>
            How does The Internet work? When you type
            <code>www.google.com</code> into your browser bar and hit enter,
            what happens next? How does your instruction turn into a
            beautifully rendered page? What are all the moving parts that come
            into play to allow you &ndash; and, simultaneously, a billion other
            people &ndash; to surf the 'net?
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a quest to find out the answer. I already know lots of
            little bits of the puzzle, but there are some that I'm rusty about,
            or which have changed significantly in the past 20 years, so I've
            got plenty of research to do! Ultimately, I'm going to condense the
            results into a book but, in the meantime, I'm producing articles on
            various associated topics.

          <h3>The HomeKit Family</h3>

          <p>
            I’ve always dreamed of having a “smart” house, where I can control
            the home environment through technology. This dream is slowly
            becoming a reality with Apple HomeKit. I'm finding that I'm on the
            bleeding edge of the early adopter curve when it comes to the
            technology. Documentation, and user experience stories, are a
            little sparse. So I'm writing articles here, and I'm collecting
            information on currently available products.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're interested in finding out more about HomeKit, I'd love
            for you to stop by, and even join in the community.

          <h3>Amazon Link</h3>

          <p>
            This is a daft wee side project, just to play around with Rails 5.
            If you use affiliate links in your articles, you're probably aware
            that Apple have geographically aware links. They'll give you a
            single URL you can put in your articles, and it will redirect
            visitors to the correct App Store for their geographical region.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amazon, on the other hand, don't seem to have this feature. But it
            can't be that difficult to implement. So that's what I'm tinkering
            with building in my spare hours right now. Worst case, it'll be
            useful to me. But you never know, it may be handy for you, too!
