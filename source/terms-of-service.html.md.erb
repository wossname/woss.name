title: Terms of Service
description: |
  I really haven't thought through what a terms of service ought to look like yet, and I probably ought not to be worrying about it just yet.

As a stopgap measure, please realise that it's just one person (Graeme) who's behind all this. I'm doing my best, but I do have other commitments, other projects, and a life. I like to have a balance across all these things! So what I really mean to say is that service is offered on a best-effort basis. If there's anything particularly time-critical, or you'd be upset if the service went offline, you really want to talk to me about it!

Does that make sense? If not, shoot me an email, to <%= mail_to_link %>, and we can talk it through.
