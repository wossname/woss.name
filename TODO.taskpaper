# Wossname Industries Web Site

Just for the LOLs, I thought it might be useful to start tracking todo lists inside my GitHub repositories, using the TaskPaper data format. I wonder if GitHub supports the TaskPaper data format in some way? That’d be pretty cool! Anyway, stuff that still wants to be done in this repository…

General tasks:
- Figure out if I can change the file extensions for articles so that `.md` is the main extension.
	That way, all the Markdown apps I use — especially on iOS — will correctly determine the file format. I’m wondering if I can drop the `.erb` bit of the extension entirely and still have it processed by ERB (perhaps by specifying it in `config.rb`) or if I can at least switch the extensions around so `.md` comes last.
- Add a README for the project. @done(2016-07-12)
	- Link to the Trello board: https://trello.com/b/Fux05K1K/5-wossname-industries @done(2016-07-12)
	- Link to the CI build on TravisCI: https://travis-ci.org/wossname/woss.name @done(2016-07-12)
	- Link to Google Analytics: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/defaultid/a73667132w111651136p116531138/ @done(2016-07-12)
	- Link to Google Tag Manager: https://tagmanager.google.com/?hl=en#/container/accounts/273912313/containers/2329943 @done(2016-07-12)
	- Links to the other associated pages on the Internet: Facebook Page, Google+ page, Twitter, etc. @done(2016-07-12)
	- Document how to build and deploy it. @done(2016-07-12)
- Add ids to all the anchor tags
	This is so that Google Analytics can correctly attribute clicked links. I should at least add ids to the links in the layouts.
- Add Product micro data to the sections in /products and /services.
- Add LocalBusiness micro data to the contact section.
- Add some more obvious share buttons at the end of each article.
- Create an obvious call to action (to get notified about new articles) at the end of each article.
- Add some unsubtle sharing links to the end of each article.
- Verify that the articles are being formatted correctly on various readability sites
	- Instapaper
	- Readability
	- Pocket
	- Safari’s reader view
- Set up redirects for the pages that no longer exist on the site, but which used to
	I need to investigate how to do this effectively with Middleman and S3. I suspect I’m going to have to write a wee plugin that will generate some boilerplate HTML pages for where I need to redirect from, with some meta-refresh tag inside them, but which also have the appropriate `x-amz-website-redirect-location` header applied to them when they’re uploaded to S3.
- Fix anything on Page Speed Insights that I have control over: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?utm_source=analytics&tab=desktop&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwoss.name%2F
	- Optimise all the images in the world ever
	- Review whether I can do anything about blocking CSS: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeCSSDelivery
		- Google Fonts
		- Main CSS file.
	- That’s about all I have control over! @done(2016-07-09)
- Figure out a workflow for getting from a source image (in Sketch?) to optimised assets for the web site.

Port articles across from mathie.github.io:
If I’m porting them across anyway, I should import them to Medium while I’m there. Probably the best strategy is to start with the ones that are generating the most 404s, seeing as they’re linked to from elsewhere on the web. Then there will be the long tail of articles that probably aren’t worth the bother.

Bigger someday/maybe projects:
- Figure out what Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are, and whether I can start generating them alongside existing pages.
- Setup Facebook Instant Articles (in progress, I think I just need to punt enough articles across to get reviewed and approved).
- Figure out a call to action for articles that convinces people to sign up to hear about future articles.
- Remove the unused CSS to reduce page load time.
- Build a brand/following!
